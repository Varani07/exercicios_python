# Let's mock a fake Airport object.
# Create a Mock object and assign it to a variable called 'airport'. 

# The airport mock should have a 'gates' attribute set to a list of the strings “A1”, “B2”, and “C3”.

# The airport mock should have a 'departures' attribute set to a dictionary where 
# the keys are strings representing cities and the 
# values are strings representating their departure times.

# {
#   "Atlanta": "12:00PM",
#   "Nashville": "04:30PM"
# }

# The airport mock should have a 'close' attribute that is callable (i.e. an instance method). 
# When invoked, it should return the string “Closing”.

# The airport should have an 'open' attribute that is callable (i.e. an instance method). .
# When invoked the first time, it should return “Opening…”. 
# When invoked the second time, it should return “Already open”.
